# DockerizedDjango
Technologies used:
1.)Docker Container
2.)Django Web Framework
3.)Gunicorn HTTP Web Server

The Goal of this Project was to use the Popular Container (Docker) with a basic Django Web App. Many ask the question well why would you want to if the Django web app
already works without it. True and thats the same thought I had but the reason why many are starting to use Docker is because it can make Developing easier when working
in a Team. 

Many times a group or a Team may all be working on different PCs and with Docker it keeps everything contained in a Container making it compatible with any PC as long as 
they have Docker desktop downloaded on there PC they can easily access the Project. Thus making working in a Team easier.

#Here is a Look at the Finished product and a Look at Docker desktop.
